## paws-sdk: Sane Promises for aws-sdk

This library provides clean promise-based APIs for aws-sdk in a seamless way. It
is a light wrapper around aws-sdk which adds '.then()' and '.catch()' methods to
an aws-request object. It does not alter the API of aws-sdk in any way otherwise.

### installation

```
npm install --save paws-sdk aws-sdk
```

`aws-sdk` is a peer dependency of this package so you must explicitly install it
alongside `paws-sdk`.

### usage

```javascript
const AWS = require('paws-sdk');

const dox = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();
dox
  .put({
    TableName: 'someThings',
    Item: someDoc
  })
  .then(response => console.log(response.data))
  .catch(error => console.error("Received Error during doc put:", error))
  .then(() => dox.scan({
    TableName: 'someThings'
  }))
  .then(response => console.log("existing documents", response.data));
```

All components of the aws-sdk should be supported. If you find anything that
doesn't work, file a github issue or pull request.

### Promise implementation

paws-sdk assumes that native promises exist and can be found as the
globally-defined `Promise`. If you are attempting to use this lib in
a version of node which does not have native Promises, you must provide
your own version before doing `require('paws-sdk');`. for example:

```javascript
global.Promise = require('lie'); // lie provides a bare-bones promises/A+ implementation
var AWS = require('paws-sdk'); // because let's be honest, if you don't have Promise, you don't have const either.
// use AWS as normal
```

### alternatives

There are a handful of other projects on npm which aim to provide something similar,
however most of them do one or more of the following, which I consider non-ideal:

1. wrapping AWS function calls: this is the na√Øve approach, which has proven in my testing to be error-prone
2. including aws-sdk as a direct dependency: peer dependencies are by far more reliable for this use case. including it as a direct dependency means that consumers of the library have no control over the AWS version used
3. exporting a different API: exporting something other than the native AWS object
4. creating a clunky API: e.g. by making you call .method(params).promise().then()
